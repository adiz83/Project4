twenty-first century. the usage of cell phones and the internet is increasing dramatically over the world, which is generating questions about consumers’ security and privacy. because of this, all users must understand cybercrime and security. cybercrime is defined as organised criminal conduct carried out by attackers online. cybercrime comes in numerous forms, such as fraud, computer viruses, cyberstalking, and others. due to these, businesses and government organisations are spending more on maintaining and employing professionals in cybercrime. 7 cyber security keywords: – 1- artificial intelligence ai has been around for quite a while now and one of its most memorable advancements was the go game between ‘alphago’, a computer go program developed by google deepmind, and the world champion lee se-dol. alphago was able to use its collected data to achieve its goal. the so-called ‘weak ai’ used on alphago is also applied to various fields within cyber security. 2. ransomware over the past years, ransomware has been aiming at innumerable targets. however, its new method of attack now aims at specific targets, where companies, communities, and public institutions are at risk. companies with strong financial powers are most likely to be their targets as the attackers will be rewarded huge sums of money for their success. those providing infra and database storage, local government and healthcare organizations, are listed as the main targets of ransomware attacks. 3. supply chain attack a supply chain attack is a cyber-attack that affects the organization by targeting less-secure elements in the supply network. supply chain attacks were already on the list of the 7 cybersecurity keywords last year, and still manage to maintain their place. such attacks will continue to infiltrate the supply chain through third-party systems and services. therefore, due to its weak security systems, those purchasing third-party vendor products and services must take extra caution. 4. cloud the interest in cloud security is on the rise. however, it is pointed out that cloud computing’s largest vulnerability is the operator’s configuration error. more complex and flexible cloud systems will eventually lead to a greater number of errors and reveal itself as a target for many cyber attackers. 5. malicious emails receiving emails containing malware is not a new thing anymore. the financial security institute warns us how malware email attacks are becoming more cunning and harder to block. spear phishing, a traditional method of attack that uses hwp and doc documents, will not stop this year. 6. internet of things (iot) building castles in the air was the perfect phrase to describe how iot was perceived. however, iot has now become a part of our lives.

threats. 7. darkweb due to several incidents, darkweb, which was only known to cyber attackers and security professionals, is now well-known to the public. for example, warez and webhard are the two

society. the government has created several cybercrime-related laws to curb the spread of crime and to protect people’s interests. these laws also provide a defence against cybercrime. aside from that, the government has established cyber cells in police stations to combat cybercrime as quickly as possible. cybercrime is an attack that can be harmful to both an individual and a business. there
